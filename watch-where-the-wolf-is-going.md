Before publishing his acclaimed novels *I Dreamt the Snow was Burning* and *Burning Patience*, Antonio Skármeta was best known in Latin America for his short stories, which won the prestigious Casa de las Américas Prize. This Readers International collection first marked the return to Chile of Antonio Skármeta from exile and now marks the memory of 50 years since the bloody coup that brought General Pinochet to power in Chile, toppling the elected government and bringing a stark choice of death or exile to so many Chileans.
<br><br>
These virtuoso stories of passion and politics, hope and disillusionment in the New World, range from the Conquistadors to the present day and from Santiago to New York and California.

*“Mr. Skármeta’s writing is imaginative, energetic and possessed of its own odd charm.”         THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW*
<br><br>
*“First-rate stories”    THE VILLAGE VOICE*, New York
<br><br>
*“Skármeta is, in the best sense, a celebratory writer…the stories themselves constantly affirm the pleasures of living in a painful world with your eyes wide open.”     
 THE INDEPENDENT*, London
<br><br>
*“The best stories in this interesting collection from one of Chile’s top writers depict the paranoia of day-to-day life under the Pinochet regime.” 
CLEVELAND PLAIN DEALER*
<br><br>
*“Drawing on Hemingway and Steinbeck, Skármeta has created a perfectly balanced collection of stories whose beauty lies in their ability to transcend the merely parochial: …the Chilean experience does not intrude upon the universal themes…. The transition from Conquistador to present-day poet is effortless…. These are the best stories I have read for a very long time.”                       CITY LIMITS*, London
