*"In knowledge of an underclass, in dialogue, in the high skill behind its plain style, this collection stands with James Joyce's Dubliners."* USA TODAY
<br><br>
*"We become thoroughly immersed in Mr Ndebele's world, the township with its tin roofs, its peach trees and garbage dumps, the sense of risk and apprehension that overhangs the daily lives of these people"* NY TIMES BOOK REVIEW
<br><br>
High praise for Njabulo Ndebele’s prize-winning stories from South Africa’s black townships, originally published in a free magazine for Soweto’s black workers commuting out to work in white Johannesburg. The author is now one of the towering literary figures of post-apartheid South Africa. This US digital edition celebrates thirty years since the first post-apartheid election of 1994 in South Africa.
<br> <br>
*“For formal elegance and originality, Fools and Other Stories surpasses anything else I’ve encountered in South African fiction, such excellent works as Burger’s Daughter and Life & Times of Michael K included.”* THE VILLAGE VOICE
