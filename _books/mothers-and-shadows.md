*"A remarkable contribution to our growing awareness – at last! – of contemporary writing by women in Latin America."* THE VILLAGE VOICE
<br><br>
Born in Argentina in 1930, Marta Traba lived in Colombia, Uruguay, France and the USA. In 1966 she won the Casa de las Américas Prize for fiction. She published 23 books on modern art, especially Latin American art, six novels, plus short stories, poetry and essays. She died in a 1983 plane crash. This, her first work in English, is now a defining classic of Latin American women's literature.

Critical acclaim for Marta Traba’s powerful novel of women face to face with Latin America’s hell of the "disappeared":

*"A record and an act of defiance."* PHILDELPHIA INQUIRER

*"As timely today as when it was first published."* LOS ANGELES REVIEW
