*"Superbly translated. Torres succeeds brilliantly in orchestrating the narrator's visions, memories, lullabies, poetry into a cohesive whole."* PUBLISHERS' WEEKLY
<br><br>
This novel of Brazil's teeming cities vibrates to a rhythm of jazz and gunshots. RI also publishes Torres' novel *The Land*, a modern classic of Brazilian literature recounting the tragedies of rural life in Brazil's arid Backlands.
