*"The dry delicacy of these stories is impressive, each a valuable channel into the art and life of modern China."* KIRKUS REVIEWS
<br><br>
Under Lu Wenfu's incisive yet tolerant eye, wonton sellers, rickshaw pullers, teachers, hedonists and bureaucrats all try to adapt to modern China's recurrent upheavals. 
<br><br>
Accent magazine (USA) calls this collection “some of the best writing from the new China”.
