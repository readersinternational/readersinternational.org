*New Portuguese Letters* is one of the great works of modern women's literature. This erotic, lyrical and profound novel of women's experience is the product of a creative alliance among three writers, all feminists, all named Maria, all mothers, all educated by nuns.
<br><br>
The Three Marias take as their inspiration the seventeenth-century European classic *Letters of a Portuguese Nun*, five passionate missives supposedly written by Sister Mariana Alcoforado to the soldier-lover who had deserted her. These modern Marias weave tales, poems and meditations around the myths and reality of contemporary women's lives.
<br><br>
When it first appeared, the book was banned and the authors were arrested and charged with obscenity and abuse of freedom of the press. Today *New Portuguese Letters* remains as fresh and challenging as when the cause of the Three Marias first lit a flame of international protest by women and for women.

*"Pitiless towards man the tyrant but often unforgettably tender towards man the tragic animal who must learn to share both his life and his inevitable death with woman — that creature whom nature has made his partner but history his slave."* from the Preface by Helen R. Lane
