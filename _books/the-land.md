*“An almost classic account of the notoriously poor area of its author’s birth.”* 
FINANCIAL TIMES
<br><br>
*“Tears at you like an early Buñuel movie”*		THE OBSERVER
<br><br>
“Vivid, moving, explosive…”		SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER
<br><br>
*“Full of the unanswered questions of a third world country in transition.”*  PUBLISHERS' WEEKLY
<br><br>

In *The Land*, Antônio Torres tells a universal story of tragic homecoming in a style that owes much to the popular cultural forms of his birthplace in the Backlands (Sertão): snatches of song and prayer, rhyming jokes and fantasies, and the *literatura de cordel* (rope literature), broadsheets telling of juicy local gossip, murders, laments, ghostly apparitions, sold in the marketplace hanging from strings of twine. 
<br><br>
First published to acclaim in 1976 as the erratic military censorship was on the wane, *The Land* now ranks in Brazil as a modern classic, available in English only from Readers International.
