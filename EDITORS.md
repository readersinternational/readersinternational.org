# Documenation for Editors
This file includes instructions for adding new books to the site.

## Adding a new book

* Take the title of the book and create a hyphenated-name for it, for example if the book is called "My Amazing Book", the hyphenated-name will be `my-amazing-book`. We'll be using this in several places.
* Create a new file in the `_books` directory with the hyphenated-name of the book followed by `.md`, for example `my-amazing-book.md`.
* Copy-paste the following metadata template into the top new file (make sure that the `---` is the first thing on the first line - no extra sapces or blank lines - and that the `---` at the bottom is not missed.)

  ```
  ---
  title: 
  author: 
  translation: 
  isbn_physical: 
  isbn_ebook: 
  region: 

  amazon: 
  goodreads: 

  cover:  ./assets/images/...
  permalink: ./...

  layout: book
  ---
  
  ... description of the book goes here ...
  ```

* Fill in the details for the book - if something does not apply for a particular book then just leave that bit blank.
  - `title` This is the title of the book, e.g. 'My Amazing Book'
  - `author` This is the author's name, e.g. 'John Smith'
  - `translation` Short sentence about translation, e.g. 'Translated from Welsh by Albert Banks"
  - `isbn_physical` The ISBN for the physical printed book, e.g. '123456789'
  - `isbn_ebook` The ISBN for the eBook, e.g. '123456789'
  - `region` Must be one of `europe`, `africa`, `asia` or `latam`.  If this is not set, or is not one of the 4 options it will not appear in the book list.
  - `amazon` Link to the eBook on amazon (include the http:// etc)
  - `goodreads`Link to the good reads review page (include the http:/// etc)
  - `cover` Link to the image file to use for the book - this should be `/assets/images/` and then the hypenated-name with the image extension, e.g. `/assets/images/my-amazing-book.jpg`
  - `permalink` This should be the hyphenated-name e.g. `my-amazing-book`
* Upload the cover image into the `assets/images` folder - make sure its name matches the hyphenated-name used for the book elsewhere, e.g. `my-amazing-book.jpg`.

## Cover Images

Top-tips for good cover images:
 
1. Aim for an image size of roughly 600 to 800 pixels on the image's longest side (typically the height).
   * It doesn't have to be an exact size - something in 600 to 800 ballpark area is fine.
   * Anything less than this and the image will look too small on the page, and may appear too blurry.
1. Save the images as a `.jpg` or a `.png`.
1. Aim for a file size of at most 100kb.
   * If the images are too large then it might take a long time to load.


## Troubleshooting issues

### Book is not appearing on the site

1. Make sure that the file added for the book is in the `_books` directory.  It *must* be in the `_books` directory and cannot be anywhere else.
1. Make sure that the file added for the book ends in `.md`.
1. Make sure that the very first thing in the file for the book is `---` on its own line.  There *cannot* be any spaces or blank lines before the `---`.
1. Make sure that there is another `---` at the end of the metadata section on its own line. There cannot be any spaces before or after it.
1. There must not be a `---` after the description. You only need `---` around the metadata.
1. Make sure that there are no spaces at the start of the line of any metadata items - e.g. `title`, `author` etc.  Each one must be on its own line without any spaces before it.
1. Make sure that there is a space after the colon for a metadata item, e.g. "title: My Amazing Book".
1. Make sure that `region` has a value of either `europe`, `africa`, `asia` or `latam`.

### The book has no image

1. Make sure the cover image exists in the `assets/images` directory.
1. Make sure the cover image file name matches the one in the metadata section of the book's `.md` file.
